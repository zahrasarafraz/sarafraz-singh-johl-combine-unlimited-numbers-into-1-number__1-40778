</div>

### Description

This is a utility in which you can combine many numbers of any range onto 1 number.

eg. like RGB function which combines three numbers of range (0-255) into as single number.

This utility can combine more than three numbers of any range eg (0-999) into a single number.

It can be used if you are making own database structure and care about memory conservation.

This is something like integration in mathematics well i don't know as i am not a maths student.

Hope you find it usefull.

you can use same sequence to decompose the number in to original numbers as used in decomposing red,green & blue values from a color.

In case of more clarifications, just email me.
